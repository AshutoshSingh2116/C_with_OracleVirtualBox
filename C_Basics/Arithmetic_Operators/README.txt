1) WAP that reads the integer and displays the right most digit of the number.
2) Read the 4 digit number and print in following formats:
eg., 4532
OP1:
2
3
5
4

OP2:
4
5
3
2


OP3:

4
4 5
4 5 3
4 5 3 2


OP4:
4 5 3 2
4 5 3
4 5
4

OP5:

2 3 5 4  


OP6:

          2
       3
     5
  4

3) Take three input integers x,y and z. Write a program to rotate their values such that, x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.

4) Input 3 digits, read them into three different characters. Make one integer out of them and display.
Eg., input 345.(stored as char c =‘3’,b=‘4’,d=‘5’.)
Output : int i = 345. ( store 345 in integer i and print the value of i as output).
